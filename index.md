# Lening Li (郦乐宁), Ph.D. 

![](./assets/logo.jpg){:style="float: right;margin-left: 7px;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"}

I am currently a Robotic Lab Advisor at Harvard University under Professor [Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/), and a Senior Software Engineer at [Symbotic](https://www.symbotic.com/), where my focus is on routing for multi-agent systems. I am proud to have earned my Ph.D. in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in December 2022, under the guidance of Professor [Jie Fu](https://fujie.ece.ufl.edu/). My research interests include Reinforcement Learning, Stochastic Optimal Control, Game Theory, Formal Methods, and Robotics.

In 2014, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and my B.A. degree in English Language and Literature from Harbin Institute of Technology, China. Following that, I pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science under the mentorship of Professor [Michael A. Gennert](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~michaelg/) at WPI, which I completed in May 2016. I continued my academic journey and earned another Master's degree in Robotics Engineering in May 2021 under the guidance of Professor Jie Fu from WPI.

Overall, my academic background and professional experience have equipped me with a diverse skill set, allowing me to make valuable contributions in the field of robotics engineering.
