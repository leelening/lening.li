# Lening Li (郦乐宁), Ph.D., MBA Candidate 

![](./assets/logo.jpg){:style="float: right;margin-left: 7px;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"}

I am currently a **Robotic Lab Advisor** at **Harvard University** (advising Prof. [Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/)'s group) and a **Senior Software Engineer** at [Symbotic](https://www.symbotic.com/), specializing in multi-agent systems. Concurrently, I am pursuing an **MBA** at **Carnegie Mellon University** (starting August 2025).

I earned my **Ph.D. in Robotics Engineering** from **Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)** in December 2022, where I was advised by Prof. [Jie Fu](https://fujie.ece.ufl.edu/). My research and professional expertise lie at the intersection of **Reinforcement Learning**, **Stochastic Optimal Control**, **Game Theory**, **Formal Methods**, and **Robotics**.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed two Master's degrees at WPI: one in **Robotics Engineering** (May 2021) and another in **Computer Science** (May 2016), advised by Prof. [Michael A. Gennert](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~michaelg/). I also hold a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in English Language and Literature from **Harbin Institute of Technology**, China (2014).

My academic background and industrial experience have equipped me with a diverse skill set to bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world robotic applications.
